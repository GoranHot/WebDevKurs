  <h1 id="alice">Alice in Chains - Down In A Hole</h1>

  <pre>
    Am I lost to wander forever
    Perhaps for the rest of my days?
    If all that has been surrendered will just go to waste
    
    You left me out in the distance
    To wander this world on my own
    Sometimes it’s so hard to admit it but I can’t let go
    I can’t let you go
    
    [Chorus:]
    Go on and take it all, go on and take it all
    Fortress coming down
    I know we can’t save it all, I know we can’t save it all
    Everything is gone
    Oh I have seen it all, oh I have seen it all
    Fortress coming down
    Go on and take it all, go on and take it all
    
    One thing I know is for certain
    We cannot have all we want
    Still this will not stop the hurting. It is never gone
    
    Now I hold on to the one thing
    Too fragile to stand on its own
    The fortress we built–it is crumbling. Still I can’t let go
    I can’t let you go
    
    [Chorus]
    
    Fortress coming down
    
    There’ll come a time, yes I know
    There’ll come a time
    You’ll look back and regret when it’s gone
    You’ll look back and regret when it’s gone
    There’ll come a time yes I know
    There’ll come a time
    You'll look back and regret when it’s gone
    You’ll look back and regret when it’s gone
    
    [Solo]
    
    In the end, too far gone, this I can’t deny
    Still I keep holding on.
    You know there’s still time
    
    On the outside looking in everything seems fine
    But the fortress caving in.
    Comes down on me tonight
    
    [Chorus]
    
    Just take it all
    Just take it all
    Just take it all

    <h1 id="porcupine">Porcupine Tree - Arriving Somewhere But No Here</h1>

    <pre>
    Never stop the car on a drive in the dark
    Never look for the truth in your mother's eyes
    Never trust the sound of rain upon a river
    Rushing through your ears

    Arriving somewhere but not here

    Did you imagine the final sound as a gun?
    Or the smashing windscreen of a car?
    Did you ever imagine the last thing you'd hear as you're fading out was a song?

    Arriving somewhere but not here

    All my designs, simplified
    And all of my plans, compromised
    All of my dreams, sacrificed

    Ever had the feeling you've been here before?
    Drinking down the poison the way you were taught
    Every thought from here on in your life begins
    And all you knew was wrong?

    Arriving somewhere but not here

    All my designs, simplified
    And all of my plans, compromised
    All of my dreams...

    Did you see the red mist block your path?
    Did the scissors cut a way to your heart?
    Did you feel the envy for the sons of mothers tearing you apart?

    Arriving somewhere but not here

    <pre>
    She seems dressed
    In all the rings of past fatalities
    So fragile yet so devious
    She continues to see it

    Climatic hands that press
    Her temples and my chest
    Enter the night that she came home
    Forever

    Oh, she's the only one that makes me sad

    She is everything and more
    The solemn hypnotic
    My Dahlia bathed in possession
    She is home to me

    I get nervous, perverse
    When I see her it's worse
    But the stress is astounding
    It's now or never she's coming home
    Forever

    Oh, she's the only one that makes me sad

    Hard to say what caught my attention
    Fixed and crazy, aphid attraction
    Carve my name in my face to recognize
    Such a pheromone cult to terrorize

    I won't let this build up inside of me [4x]

    Yeah!

    I'm a slave and I am a master
    No restraints and unchecked collectors
    I exist through my need to self-oblige
    She is something in me that I despise

    I won't let this build up inside of me [8x]

    [4x]
    She isn't real!
    I can't make her real!

    <h1 id="jerry">Jerry Cantrell - Anger Rising</h1>

    <pre>
    Alabama trailer park they call home
    Boy standing at attention in the corner his own
    Terrified, scorpion crawling the wall
    By the way father could you please beat me some more?

    Anger rising up inside him yet again
    Tell me you got a plan
    Deaf and blind I'm living with the lepers and
    You want to hold my hand

    Cold Alaska, hiding, bundled up tight
    Stretch aluminum foil 'cross the window at night
    Mother crying, calling out up the stairs
    By the way father do you even care that I'm scared?

    Anger rising up inside him yet again
    Tell me you got a plan
    Deaf and blind I'm living with the lepers and
    You want to hold my hand

    Devil rising up inside him yet again
    Tell me you got a plan
    Deaf and blind I'm living with the lepers and
    You want to hold my hand

    Generation three, solitary, alone
    By the way father created hell on my own

    Anger rising up inside him yet again
    Tell me you got a plan
    Deaf and blind I'm living with the lepers and
    You want to hold my hand
